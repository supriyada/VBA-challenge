#Stock Market data analysis:

Language used: VBA

Each row in the input data set contains information regarding a stock's open price, high price, low price, close price and total volume of that stock traded on each day for 3 years. Each sheet of the input file has the above mentioned data for a list of stocks for each day of a year.

The first part of this project computes the yearly change in stock value, percentage change in stock value and total stock volume for a year for each of the stocks listed in the input.

The second part of this project computes the stock with greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease and greatest total volume from the output dataset of the first part.

The input data resource files:
	* alphabetical_testing.xlsx --> used as sample while developing scripts.
	* Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx	--> Fully functional script is run on this file to generate the final report.

After successful completion of the script on one sheet, looped it through all the sheets.

The VBA script works successfully across multiple worksheets of data in Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx.

The screenshots of the succesful outcomes are also captured and included.
